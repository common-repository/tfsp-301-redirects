TFSP 301 Redirects provides redirecting requests to your website pages to another page or site elsewhere on the web.

== Description ==

TFSP 301 Redirects gives a simple technique for diverting solicitations to another page on your webpage or somewhere else on the web. It's particularly convenient when you relocate a site to WordPress and can't save your URL structure. By setting up 301 sidetracks from your old pages to your new pages, any approaching connections will be seamlessly passed along, and their page rank (or what-have-you) will be passed alongside them.
